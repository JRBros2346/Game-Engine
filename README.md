# Yazh
Yazh is my fork of [Kohi Game Engine](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), following along with his Youtube series and adding my own flavor to it.

Following [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi)'s name following four letter non-English names, my game engine is named after a Tamil word யாழ்  (write: [yazh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazh); read: yaal, with a retroflex approximant 'l'; IPA: [jaːɻ]) which was a Harp used in Ancient Tamil Music.

# Goals
- Make it as good as Kohi
- C++ is the main programming language
- Python as Build System
- G++ compiler
- Physics Engine should be based on Geometric Algebra

# Specs
- C++17 compliant compiler: (I recommend using g++, I use [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) because all the scripts are written for g++. But you may use other compilers by editting the build scripts)
- VulkanSDK version 3.x: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
- Python3: https://www.python.org

# Compiling
- Build via `python build`
- Run `testbed` in `bin` folder
