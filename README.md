# Yazh
Yazh is my fork of [Kohi Game Engine](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi), following along with his Youtube series and adding my own flavor to it.

Following [Kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi)'s and [Nara](https://github.com/Eearslya/Nara)'s names following four letter non-English names, my game engine is named after a Tamil word யாழ்  (write: [yazh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazh); read: yaal, with a retroflex approximant 'l'; IPA: [jaːɻ]) which was a Harp used in Ancient Tamil Music.

# Goals
